# Scripto - A lazy bash scripting library for everyone

## Overview

I started writing this project since the first time I learned about bash scripting in 2020. It's actually a really cool scripting language to me!

I learned a lot from open source community and that is the reason I want to give back something to this community.

For people who want to learn about Bash scripting, I hope you will find some interesting and useful code snippets from my project.

**Please note that this project was originally designed for my personal use, so it may not be suitable for everyone. However, I hope you can find some useful code snippets that can help you in your own projects.**
